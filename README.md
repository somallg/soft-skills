# Section 1 - Habits And The Brain
> I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix - Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlook Holmes)
* Habits form slowly. The brain is a two-part system

## Lecture 3: Habits And The Brain: A Primer
* What ARE Habits?
  * Something that a person does often in a regular and repeated way
  * A behavior that's easier to do than not to do

* WHY Do We Have Habits?
  1. Easy
  2. Energy-efficient
  3. Automatic

* Why Do We Have BAD Habits?
  * Low difficulty + High Reward + Instant Gratification = BRAIN APPROVED

* Why DON'T We Have More Good Habits?
  * Highest Reward - Delayed Gratification - High difficulty = BRAIN WANTS CAKE NOW

* The Bran's Two-Part System
  * Prefrontal Cortex: The Conscious Manager
  * Basal Ganglia: The Subconscious Repeater

## Lecture 4: The Damaged Frontal Lobes Study Brought To Life!
* Without the prefrontal cortex, we're nearly robots
* The PC and subconscious brain share power and attention
* Our subconscious works very differently!

## Lecture 5: Science Break: The Damaged Basal Ganglia Study

## Lecture 6: Coffee Break Wrap-Up (Section 1)

# Section 2 - Motivation
> I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to work. - Perl S. Buck
* If motivation is your starting strategy, you will fail.

## Lecture 7: Motivation's Popularity, The Two Definitions, & The Famous Pumpkin Cat
* Motivation's Two Definitions
  1. The **reason or reasons** one has for acting or behaving in a particular way
    * Based on **values**
    * Reliable and **stable**
  2. The general desire or **willingness** of someone to do something **in the moment**
    * Based on **feelings**
    * Fickle and **unpredictable**

## Lecture 8: Motivation Science Break

## Lecture 9: Motivation In Action!
* "Feeling bombs" kill it
* Waiting for it is ineffective
* It will decrease over time

## Lecture 10: Coffee Break Wrap-Up (Section 2)
* The best way to get motivation its to take action first

# Section 3 - Willpower
> Willpower is essential to accomplishment of anything worthwhile - Brian Tracy
* Willpower works every time... until you run out of it

## Lecture 11: Why Willpower Beats Motivation
* Using willpower, you can force yourself to act regardless of feelings (Habits require this kind of consistency)
* **If you can make your willpower last, success is guaranteed**

* Making a decision in advance is smarter
  * It separates you from the emotion of the moment
* Willpower lets you put it on the calendar and do it

## Lecture 12: The Cookie Radish Study Brought To Life!

## Lecture 13: Science Reveals The Biggest Five Threats To Willpower Energy
* 5 major willpower drainers identified
  1. Effort: "Strenuous physical or mental exertion"
  2. Perceived Difficulty: how difficult you **believe** your objective is
  3. Subjective Fatigue: how fatigued you **think** you are
  4. Negative Affect: the experience of negative feelings
  5. Low Blood Glucose: the body's primary energy source; fuel

## Lecture 14: Willpower In Action!

## Lecture 15: Coffee Break Wrap-Up (Section 3)
* We change our habits by using motivation or willpower to "manually" change our behavior
* Motivation isn't reliable, so it is a poor strategy for building habits
* Willpower is reliable, but only if you don't run out of it
* If we can overcome the five willpower drainers, we can act with remarkable consistency and find success

# Section 4 - Mini Habits Strategy
> Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win - Sun Tzu, The Art of War

* Consistency, not quantity is most important

## Lecture 28: Step Eight: Look For Signs Of Habit (Careful!)
1. **No resistance**: it's easier to do than not to do
2. **Identity**: you identify with the behavior; it describes you
3. **Mindless action**: you just do the behavior without thinking much about it
4. **No concern/worry**: you don't worry about doing it, because you know you will
5. **Normalization**: habits are as normal and expected as waking up in the morning
6. **Boring**: things that are "the norm" are less exciting (but the results can be exciting)

1. The trigger: context (internal thought, external stimulus)

4. The reward: you're rewareded for doing it

## Lecture 34: Rerouting - The Second Line Of Defense
* Quickly take one small step in a different direction than your undesired behavior(s) when tempted
* You need **fast speed** and **small size**

## Lecture 35: Should You Attempt To Quit "Cold Turkey"?
* Bad habits are... poisonous to your well-being!
* Scaling back is generally an inferior solution (with exceptions)
  * It's dangerous because of contined exposure and not addressing the root problem (eradicating the process)
  * It's somewhat beneficial for self-control practice

# Section 8 - Modification & Conclusion

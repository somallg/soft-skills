# Become a SuperLearner 2: Learn Speed Reading & Boost Memory

# Section 1. Introduction & setting yourself up for success

## 1.1 About us: how this course came to be

## 1.2 Downloading the course resources & overview
* Learning is NOT a spectator sport
* If it's not in your hands, it's not in your head
* http://jle.vi/pdf2
* 5 to 6 sessions of about 40 minutes in length every week
* There is such a thing as working too hard
* No more than 8 hours per week

## 1.3 Progressive overload & what to do if you get frustrated
* Progressive overload: always be training near or just below your limits
* Immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain progress
* Periodization
* Variations in intensity and volume of training
* Vary the training intensity to suit your needs and your progress
* When learning comes easily, it doesn't stick
* That doesn't mean that it's going to be effortless

* Things TODO:
  * Complete the goal and progress worksheet
  * Post it publicly near your desk
  * Identify the 3-5 goals you have for this course
  * The reason you want to accomplish those goals. Be specific
  * Checkout the articles and PDF syllabus
  * The pomodoro technique

* Remind: You can do this

## 1.4 Personal Goals & Progress Worksheet

## 1.5 Diagnostic Worksheet \#1: Establish a baseline reading speed and retention

## Quiz 6: Are we on the same page and ready to learn together?

# Section 2. Understanding your memory (so that you can improve it!)

## 2.7 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz!

## 2.8 Why we need to improve our memory first
* We have to first upgrade the bucket
* Working memory: very short term memory that allows us to interact with and process information (i.e listening to a complete sentence)
* Our brains use several different types of buffers
* Words, ideas, images, and scenes, do not all use the same path to get to short term memory
* Short term memory: the memory function used to keep information for 15-20 seconds
* Our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks
* We're expected to just "remember" things
* This is the general theory on how to improve learning
* Apply those skills in your daily life
* If you don't use it, you literally lose it

## 2.9 How we store information: a very brief explanation
* Your mind is made up of about 100 billion tiny little cells called neurons
* Synapses: specialized connections between neurons
* Memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time
* The creation of memories requires connection between two neurons
* Neurons work better in these types of clusters
* The hippocampi tell our brain what's worth remembering
* The more connection there are to a piece of information... the more likely your hippocampi are to determine that it's worth storing
* Our brains have a capacity of about 2.5 petabytes
* The more connections we make between our memories, the less likely they are to fade away
* Create more connections to the information we want to learn
* What about in the adult brain?
* Research shows that adults learn just as well as children, if not better!
* 5 requirements for adult learning
  1. Self-concept - Adults are self-directed and independent. They need to take an active role in creating their learning experience
  2. The role of experience - Adults have a growing reservoir of experience (including mistakes) that is a critical resource for learning
  3. Readiness to learn - Adults are most ready to learn things that are pertinent to their daily life situations
  4. Orientation to learning - Adults respond best to learning things that will be immediately applicable. Adults are more problem-centered than subject-centered in their learning
  5. Motivation to learn - For adults, the motivation to learn is internal: this means that they must know why they need to learn this information

## 2.10 Chunking: Navigating the brain's natural limitations
* The working and short term memory can only remember sequences of 7 +- 2 pieces of information
* Chunking is an entry level mnemonic technique
* It's also a critical element of the overall technique
* It works with just about everything

## 2.11 Demonstration: Chunking
* Short-term visual memory training
  * Split into quadrants (areas)
* 20 random words generator
  * Chunking by area
  * Chunking by meaning

## 2.12 Chunking Worksheet

## 2.13 Dual coding & 'brute force' learning
* "Brute Force Learning": to learn from diverse forms of material and various angles
* The most successful learners attack a piece of material from many angles or perspectives
* Strengthen the neural network associated with what you're trying to learn
* Engage with the material in different ways
* Once taught is twice learned
* Share what you've learned so far with your friends!

## Quiz 14: How much do we understand about our memory?

# Section 3. The incredible power of visual memory

## 3.15 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz II

## 3.16 Why images are the most powerful way to remember & learn
* Visual information is simply easier to recall than auditory information
* Pictures are more heavily encoded
* A picture is worth a thousand words
* A photo is just information
* 30,000 words per minute
* Transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures
* Makers: imaginary pictures or visual associations used to represent information we want to remember
* The best, and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre or emotionally connected to memories

## 3.17 When & why creativity training may be necessary
* Transform any and every piece of information you want to remember into an image
* It takes creativity to try and rapidly generate a mental image for things
* Creativity is something we are all born with
* We can easily gain it back
* You can kick-start your creativity
* It's up to you to decide if you need to practice creativity

## 3.18 What types of images come naturally to you?
* You too will build up a visual library

## Quiz 19: Do we understand how visual memory works?

# Section 4. Mental markers: visual memory meets learning

## 4.20 How do we apply visual memory to reading?
* Batching like tasks
* There are 3 stages of memory
  1. Encoding
  2. Storage
  3. Retrieval
* Untrained readers try to do all 3 stages at once
* Grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimizing waste
* Makes short pauses of about 1-2 seconds
* Longer pauses every 10 minutes or less
* Your brain needs to periodically repeat and review information
* "Play back" or retrieve our stored markers
* We need to master the concept of "Markers"
* Not all markers have to be visual
* Smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision
* Markers remind us of the details that we've decided we need to remember
* Allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory

## 4.21 Demonstration: Visualization of words and concepts from text

## 4.22 Creating effective markers for better memory
* Markers are really at the heart of the entire SuperLearning methodology
* What makes a good, high-quality, memorable marker that can be easily linked and stored in our long term memory?
  1. Good markers represent a concept
    * A very specific and detailed concept that can be easily retrieved from the memory
    * Encode each of the significant details of the paragraph
    * Remember at least four concrete and related details for each summarizing marker
  2. Good markers are imbued with rich details
  3. Good markers can be easily connected to the other markers that come with it
    * Each detail encodes some information
    * Prioritize details over generic concepts
    * Focus on memorizing those nitty-gritty details
  4. Good markers can be easily and quickly converted to images
  5. Good markers prioritize the solution or resolution, not the question
  6. A good marker connects to existing information whenever possible
* A lot of the knowledge you're trying to acquire is loosely related to existing knowledge
* Try to create a marker or a detail within another marker for every single detail that you deem important
* About two markers per paragraph with around 4 details each
* 10 to 20 markers per page
* You won't always remember them all
* You're going to have to practice for a long time

## 4.23 Logical & creative markers
* Examples of logical markers can include:
  * Emotions such as excitement, anger, or confusion
  * Symbols such as question marks or exclamation points
  * Arrows, X's, Circles, check marks, and diagrams, schematics, or flow charts
* Logical markers are very individualized

## 4.24 Trying out your new skills
* Your homework is to try these new skills out
* Create a marker
* We're also training your creativity and marker generation skills

## 4.25 Linking & chunking markers for better retention
* You should be able to describe the ways that they're connected
  using logical markers
* You should be able to play them back like a film strip
* Markers and their sub-details usually come in chucks
* You can group markers together by different possible logical chunks
* Examples grocery store
  * 20 markers - one for each of these important items
  * "Chunk" the list into departments
  * Build your own story
* Compound marker
* Any set of markers can be chunked and linked with enough creativity
* 4-7 objects
* Visualize the first and the last
* Avoid inserting information that was not originally in the text
* Experiment with the different ways of chunking and packaging markers

## 4.26 Demonstration: Putting it all together with random facts
* We have greatly improved our comprehension and retention of the
  information we read
* Don't worry about doing all of this stuff while you actually read
* Practice these technique by taking pauses during normal reading
* We'll dive more into the process flow and timing of marker creation
  when we dive into speed reading
* Soon, you'll learn how to apply markers to anything you want to
  learn...
* This lecture will show you how to create and link markers using the
  marker technique
* These examples should help you see the types of markers we hope you'll
  be making
* Google random facts
* Each detail itself become a sub-marker which is carefully linked into
  the central marker
* Created an overall marker, comprised of animated, action-packed
  sub-markers

## Quiz 28: How well do we understand markers?

# Section 5. Pre-reading and preparation

## 5.29 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz III

## 5.30 Introducing the SQ3R System
* SQ3R
  * Survey => skim or scan the content before we read it to prepare our mind
  * Quesiton => ask ourselves questions to improve motivation
  * Read => do not reread or dwell on irrelevant details
  * Recall => add details to the markers after reading each paragraph
  * Review => see what you learned and try to connect it to previous knowledge
* Pre-reading is a speed-reader's hidden weapon
* Enhance curiosity and focus, improve reading speed, and boost overall retention

## 5.31 Pre-read before you read
* Survey (v): to investigate, examine, question, and record information
* Pre-reading helps us speed up, priming our brain for reading the text
* Read five to eight times our current reading speed
* Just looking for
  * Titles
  * Sub-headings
  * Proper nouns
  * Numbers
  * Words
  * Or things that just don't seem to fit it
* Generate thoughts and ideas about the text

## 5.32 Creating burning interest: Perspectives, prior knowledge, & W/H questions
* Adult learners need to be curious about what they're learning and
  connect it to their existing knowledge
* Inspire within yourself a burning curiosity or interest
* How to do that:
  1. Envision yourself using the material
  2. Start asking questions
  3. Consider different perspectives
    * What viewpoint do I anticipate the author taking?
    * What viewpoint do I have going into reading this article?
    * Where might the author be wrong?
    * Where am I open to being persuaded on this topic?
    * How could this material be improved?
    * What would critics of this article likely say?
    * Who are some people I know who might agree or disagree with what this article likely says?
    * What would I expect to see in this text that I am not seeing at this speed?
* You'll have a lot of questions that you're very eager to answer

## 5.33 Demonstration: Pre-reading
* Keep in mind: pre-reading is highly individual!
* The words that catch your interest may differ from the examples given
* Based on how much detail you want to retain and the format of the text, you should decide how much to pre-read in advance

## Quiz 34: Are we all clear on pre-reading?

# Section 6. Read with your eyes, not with your inner voice

## 6.35 How to properly test your comprehension without fooling yourself
* Confirmation bias
* Jot down everything you remember on paper or a text document
* You can learn a lot from the details you neglected or remembered incorrectly
* Ask yourself why it happened
* Sometimes, a bias towards specific types of information is a good thing
* You'll be able to identify and recall every detail, concept, and idea that you deem pertinent
* Work this exercise into your normal training

## 6.36 Diagnostic Worksheet \#2: Establish a new reading speed and retention

## 6.37 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz IV

## 6.38 How most people read: subvocalization
* When we're taught to read, we have to sound it out
* This is a very hard habit to break
* Subvocalization takes high quality visual information and degrades the quality and bandwidth
* Subvocalization maxes out at 250 WPM
* Speed reading starts at 450 WPM
* Your brain requires only 13 milliseconds to recognize an image
* Subvocalization leads to distraction and poor focus
* By subvocalizing, you're trying to perform the encoding, the storage and retrieval processes all at once
* Written words are just another form for visual symbols
1. More efficient encoding
2. More efficient storage
3. More delibrate retrieval

## 6.39 Saccades: using your eyes as effectively as possible
* Our eyes are actually incapable of making smooth, gradual movements
* Saccade (n): the quick, precise, "jumping" movement made by the eye
* Fixation (n): the point between two saccades where the eye is stationary and focused
* Average readers do 10 to 20 small saccades per line of text
* Whenever your eyes are in motion, they are not sending information to the brain
  * Saccadic masking or "saccadic blindness"
* 1 or 2 saccades per line  
* This is the basis for all speed reading

## 6.40 Improving your eye span: wider saccades
* We can train the eye to have a wider fixation
* Schultz tables
* The best speed readers can reach up to 12 words in one fixation
* 

## 6.41 Using saccades across various devices and media
* It's important to learn how to speed read in any condition
* We don't recommend using "automation" software
  * Those tools do not train you to make the most efficient eye movements
* Format reading materials into the most ideal speed reading layout, whenever possible
* To to get reading materials in .mobi or .epub native formats
* Experiment with some of the apps, extensions, and services we've recommended

## 6.42 Final thoughts on saccades
* "You have to make sure you're reading the black stuff, not the white stuff"
* Include some overlap between your saccades

* This course won't serve as a full crash course in any one area
* Instead, you'll get an introduction & explanation to new ideas & tools
* Supplementary materials are carefully curated and comprise a large part of this course
* Only if you explore on your own and extend your learning exprerience will you succeed as a student

* Speed demon is a community - please submit additional resources!
* Pre-quizzes test you on things you haven't learned yet, for a number of importnat reasons

* Not every hack if for everyone. It's ok to pick & choose!

## Lecture 3: Why do things quicker?
* Knowing why we're learning is important to ensure a successful
learning experience
* What is the practical application? or how will we use the new knowledge?
* Being more efficient doesn't always mean being more productive
* Time may be the most finite resource; but time without **attention** is worthless
* Respect your self, your wellbeing, and your limits

## Lecture 4: Where most people spend (or waste) their time

## Lecture 5: Course Syllabus

# Section 2 - General Principles & Theories for Hacking Productivity

## Quiz 2: Pre-Quiz: Let's see what we already know?

## Lecture 6: The power of preparation
> Measure twice, and cut once - German proverb
> Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpeing the axe - Abraham Lincoln
* Proper preparation is important for almost anything you do in life

## Lecture 7: Having clear priorities & goals - and making them "SMART"
* Specific
* Measurable
* Assignable
* Realistic
* Time-Related

## Lecture 8: Organizing priorities with the Prority Star Exercise
* As we've learned, preparation, priorities, and goals are important
* Having our goals and priorities pre-arranged makes us more effective
* But how do we rank our tasks & projects in order of importance?
  * Interconnect each possible pair - draw an arrow showing which item will help or drive which
  * Count up the outgoing arrows - from each item
* The Prority Star works for all kinds of different task types
* It works best for related tasks that have some loose relation

## Lecture 9: Setting deadline - and making them real
* **Parkinson's Law**: "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"
* Truly "artificial" deadlines are too easy to blow off or ignore
* You can use everyday events to make your "artificial" deadlines into real ones

## Lecture 10: The Pareto Principle: our secret to being effective
* **The Pareto Principle**: 80% of the benefits come from 20% of the efforts - and vice versa
* 20% of the words in a language make up 80% of conversations
* 20% of the work of cooking makes 80% of the difference in taste
* >= 80% of the news you read only adds 20% of new information
* <= 20% of your friends and family give you >= 80% of your happiness
* 20% of the tips in this course will deliver 80% of the value for you

## Lecture 11: The "Bad" kind of multitasking, avoiding distractions, and mediation
* When switching tasks, it takes time and effort to get back into focus
* It can take as long as **15 minutes** to get back into the optimal state of concentration!
* Traditional "Multitasking" causes a lack of focus, inefficiency, and sub-standard work quality
* Meditation can train us to maintain our focus, thereby bosting mental performance
* A surprising majority of very productive people practice regular meditation

## Lecture 12: Batching similiar tasks
* Batching similar tasks allows us to "amortize" (or spread) time-consuming set-up & recovery work

## Lecture 13: The "Good" kind of multitasking & the Buddist wheel of life
* The Wheel of Life
  1. Family & Friends
  2. Significant Other/Romance
  3. Fun & Recreation
  4. Health
  5. Money
  6. Personal Growth
  7. Physical Environment
  8. Career
* Some activities can be done together in a way that's mutually productive
* Always try to nurture two pieces of the Wheel of Life at the same time

## Lecture 14: Planning for structured rest periods
* Planning on breaks forces us to use a nuber of good habits

## Lecture 15: Using small chunks of wasted time effectively
* We often waste hours in the day on small chunks of time that add up - but it doesn't have to be this way
* Often, small tasks don't get done because they are distracting when there are bigger priorities to do
* Make a list of "5-10 minutes task" to eliminate any thinking or decisions in-the-moment

## Lecture 16: A brief note on "Flow" and focus
* **Remember**: Time without attention is worthless
* **Flow (n)**: The mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity
* Flow is the driving force behind everything we've taught so far
* There are 7 conditions required for Flow
  1. Knowing what to do
  2. Knowing how to do it
  3. Knowing how well you're doing
  4. Knowing where to to
  5. High perceived challenges
  6. High perceived skills
  7. Freedom from distractions

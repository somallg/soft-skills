# Become a SuperLearner 2: Learn Speed Reading & Boost Memory

# Section 1. Introduction & setting yourself up for success

## 1.1 About us: how this course came to be

## 1.2 Downloading the course resources & overview
* Learning is NOT a spectator sport
* If it's not in your hands, it's not in your head
* http://jle.vi/pdf2
* 5 to 6 sessions of about 40 minutes in length every week
* There is such a thing as working too hard
* No more than 8 hours per week

## 1.3 Progressive overload & what to do if you get frustrated
* Progressive overload: always be training near or just below your limits
* Immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain progress
* Periodization
* Variations in intensity and volume of training
* Vary the training intensity to suit your needs and your progress
* When learning comes easily, it doesn't stick
* That doesn't mean that it's going to be effortless

* Things TODO:
  * Complete the goal and progress worksheet
  * Post it publicly near your desk
  * Identify the 3-5 goals you have for this course
  * The reason you want to accomplish those goals. Be specific
  * Checkout the articles and PDF syllabus
  * The pomodoro technique

* Remind: You can do this

## 1.4 Personal Goals & Progress Worksheet

## 1.5 Diagnostic Worksheet \#1: Establish a baseline reading speed and retention

## Quiz 6: Are we on the same page and ready to learn together?

# Section 2. Understanding your memory (so that you can improve it!)

## 2.7 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz!

## 2.8 Why we need to improve our memory first
* We have to first upgrade the bucket
* Working memory: very short term memory that allows us to interact with and process information (i.e listening to a complete sentence)
* Our brains use several different types of buffers
* Words, ideas, images, and scenes, do not all use the same path to get to short term memory
* Short term memory: the memory function used to keep information for 15-20 seconds
* Our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks
* We're expected to just "remember" things
* This is the general theory on how to improve learning
* Apply those skills in your daily life
* If you don't use it, you literally lose it

## 2.9 How we store information: a very brief explanation
* Your mind is made up of about 100 billion tiny little cells called neurons
* Synapses: specialized connections between neurons
* Memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time
* The creation of memories requires connection between two neurons
* Neurons work better in these types of clusters
* The hippocampi tell our brain what's worth remembering
* The more connection there are to a piece of information... the more likely your hippocampi are to determine that it's worth storing
* Our brains have a capacity of about 2.5 petabytes
* The more connections we make between our memories, the less likely they are to fade away
* Create more connections to the information we want to learn
* What about in the adult brain?
* Research shows that adults learn just as well as children, if not better!
* 5 requirements for adult learning
  1. Self-concept - Adults are self-directed and independent. They need to take an active role in creating their learning experience
  2. The role of experience - Adults have a growing reservoir of experience (including mistakes) that is a critical resource for learning
  3. Readiness to learn - Adults are most ready to learn things that are pertinent to their daily life situations
  4. Orientation to learning - Adults respond best to learning things that will be immediately applicable. Adults are more problem-centered than subject-centered in their learning
  5. Motivation to learn - For adults, the motivation to learn is internal: this means that they must know why they need to learn this information

## 2.10 Chunking: Navigating the brain's natural limitations
* The working and short term memory can only remember sequences of 7 +- 2 pieces of information
* Chunking is an entry level mnemonic technique
* It's also a critical element of the overall technique
* It works with just about everything

## 2.11 Demonstration: Chunking
* Short-term visual memory training
  * Split into quadrants (areas)
* 20 random words generator
  * Chunking by area
  * Chunking by meaning

## 2.12 Chunking Worksheet

## 2.13 Dual coding & 'brute force' learning
* "Brute Force Learning": to learn from diverse forms of material and various angles
* The most successful learners attack a piece of material from many angles or perspectives
* Strengthen the neural network associated with what you're trying to learn
* Engage with the material in different ways
* Once taught is twice learned
* Share what you've learned so far with your friends!

## Quiz 14: How much do we understand about our memory?

# Section 3. The incredible power of visual memory

## 3.15 Misconceptions Pre-Quiz II

## 3.16 Why images are the most powerful way to remember & learn
* Visual information is simply easier to recall than auditory information
* Pictures are more heavily encoded
* A picture is worth a thousand words
* A photo is just information
* 30,000 words per minute
* Transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures
* Makers: imaginary pictures or visual associations used to represent information we want to remember
* The best, and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre or emotionally connected to memories

## 3.17 When & why creativity training may be necessary
* Transform any and every piece of information you want to remember into an image
* It takes creativity to try and rapidly generate a mental image for things
* Creativity is something we are all born with
* We can easily gain it back
* You can kick-start your creativity
* It's up to you to decide if you need to practice creativity

## 3.18 What types of images come naturally to you?
* You too will build up a visual library

## Quiz 19: Do we understand how visual memory works?

# Section 4. Mental markers: visual memory meets learning

## 4.20 How do we apply visual memory to reading?
* Batching like tasks
* There are 3 stages of memory
  1. Encoding
  2. Storage
  3. Retrieval
* Untrained readers try to do all 3 stages at once
* Grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimizing waste
* Makes short pauses of about 1-2 seconds
* Longer pauses every 10 minutes or less
* Your brain needs to periodically repeat and review information
* "Play back" or retrieve our stored markers
* We need to master the concept of "Markers"
* Not all markers have to be visual
* Smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision
* Markers remind us of the details that we've decided we need to remember
* Allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory

## 4.21 Demonstration: Visualization of words and concepts from text

## 4.22 Creating effective markers for better memory
* Markers are really at the heart of the entire SuperLearning methodology
* What makes a good, high-quality, memorable marker that can be easily linked and stored in our long term memory?
  1. Good markers represent a concept
    * A very specific and detailed concept that can be easily retrieved from the memory
    * Encode each of the significant details of the paragraph
    * Remember at least four concrete and related details for each summarizing marker
  2. Good markers are imbued with rich details
  3. Good markers can be easily connected to the other markers that come with it
    * Each detail encodes some information
    * Prioritize details over generic concepts
    * Focus on memorizing those nitty-gritty details
  4. Good markers can be easily and quickly converted to images
  5. Good markers prioritize the solution or resolution, not the question
  6. A good marker connects to existing information whenever possible
* A lot of the knowledge you're trying to acquire is loosely related to existing knowledge
* Try to create a marker or a detail within another marker for every single detail that you deem important
* About two markers per paragraph with around 4 details each
* 10 to 20 markers per page
* You won't always remember them all
* You're going to have to practice for a long time

## 4.23 Logical & creative markers
* Examples of logical markers can include:
  * Emotions such as excitement, anger, or confusion
  * Symbols such as question marks or exclamation points
  * Arrows, X's, Circles, check marks, and diagrams, schematics, or flow charts
* Logical markers are very individualized
* What is your option?
